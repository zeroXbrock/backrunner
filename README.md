# backrunner

> :warning: *none of this is production-ready, nor should it be construed as being good in any way*

- [x] watch transactions from specific addresses in the mempool
  - [x] detect uniswap trades
- [x] craft a backrun arb
- [x] write arb executor contract
- [~] execute arb using Flashbots

> :warning: Running a mempool backrunner can be risky. There are poison tokens that drain your liquidity when you trade them. See [salmonella](https://github.com/Defi-Cartel/salmonella) for an example.
