# backrunner

> :warning: *none of this is production-grade, nor should it be construed as being good in any way. I've taken a lot of shortcuts and cut a lot of corners. If you run this you will probably get rekt by poison tokens.*

- [x] watch transactions from uniswap trades in the mempool
- [x] craft a backrun arb
- [x] write arb executor contract
- [x] send backrun bundle to Flashbots (sim only)

Running a mempool backrunner can be risky. There are poison tokens that drain your liquidity when you trade them. See [salmonella](http://TODO-add-link.pls) for an example.
