# backrunner

- [x] watch transactions from specific addresses in the mempool
  - [x] uniswap trades; addresses TBD
- [x] craft a backrun arb
- [x] write arb executor contract
- [x] ~~execute~~ simulate arb using Flashbots

## iterations

None of these are quite done or functional, but they provide a general structure and approach for backrunning, and may be useful for learning.
